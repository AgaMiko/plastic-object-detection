Additionaly we have checked one segmentation model: Masked RCNN. We have recived 3000 more annotated waste images form Epinote. We divided work into teams, so we can compare final results. Every team uploaded their work to our Github."

Additionally we have started to try out some data augmentation techniques: classic transformations as zoom in/out, rotation but also color augmentation and artificial snow and rain. Moreover we have discovered multiple more datasets with waste designed for segmentation, detection and classification which we added to our TACO dataset. Huge boost of data made us to re-define models' pipeline."
