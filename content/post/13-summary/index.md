After five months and around 1000 (wo)man-hours of uphill battle we successfully finished our project. The "detect waste" will be a memorable experience for many of us. We finished with over 80 commits to the official repository, 500 experiments in 5 projects on neptune.ai (and untracked numerous trainings), thousands of lines of code.



# Summary of the project
We proposed a two-stage ML model and provided extensive review of datasets and approaches in litter detection.
Check out the summary of our project [Creating an AI to Combat Environmental Pollution](https://towardsdatascience.com/ai-to-combat-environmental-pollution-6d58b0bf6a1) written by Magdalena Kortas and Sylwia Majchrowska on **towards data science**.
We additionally publish our results on **arxiv**: [Waste detection in Pomerania: non-profit project for detecting waste in environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06808), authored by: Sylwia Majchrowska, Agnieszka Mikołajczyk, Maria Ferlin, Zuzanna Klawikowska, Marta A. Plantykow, Arkadiusz Kwasigroch, Karol Majek.
