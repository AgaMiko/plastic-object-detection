I am a PhD candidate at the Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP) of the University of Surrey. I have been working under the supervision of Prof. Mark Plumbley.

My main research interest is Machine Listening combining of machine learning and digital signal processing to extract information from sound. In simpler words, I develop methods for making sense of sounds around us, from bird songs to city soundscapes.

I am particularly interested in matrix factorization and deep learning methods.

Before joining CVSSP I worked for 3 years in Samsung Electronics R&D Centre as a software engineer in Natural Language Processing group.

I encourage you to explore my research, publications and code.
