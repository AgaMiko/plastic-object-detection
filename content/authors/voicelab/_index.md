VoiceLab is a technology firm from Gdańsk, working on automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language understanding (NLU).

Our team of high-class specialists is working on improving automatic speech recognition in many languages using large amounts of acoustic and text data.

With the use of deep neural networks, a very large dataset consisting of several thousand hours of hand-labelled data, a number of powerful servers (over 40 GPU cards, HPC), we are building large acoustic models, language models, and dictionaries in many languages. Our main goal is to ​​constantly improve the quality of recognition.

Using our technologies we have created a number of interesting products, mainly in the SaaS model, for automatic speech recognition (smartphone/desktop apps), process automation, Conversational Intelligence, voicebots, and even offline solutions for smart homes - wherever there is a need for speech recognition and language understanding our technology can be applied and used.

VoiceLab solutions are used by thousands of people.
