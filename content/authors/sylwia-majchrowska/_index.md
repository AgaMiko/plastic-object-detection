Sylwia completed master studies in mathematics at the University of Wrocław, as well as in physics at the Wrocław University of Science and Technology, where she continues her education towards the doctorate degree. Currently she investigates novel nonlinear optical phenomena that occur in multimode optical fibers by developing numerical tools to identify the impact of several modeling approximations for typical experimental parameters. 
In her professional career, she is designing and developing deep learning algorithms for image processing using neural network models. She was a member of a team working on developing a method to automate the analysis of bacterial colonies on Petri dishes using artificial neural networks and machine learning algorithms, in particular, to classify the type of bacteria and to determine the number of colonies. 
She is also a mentor in many volunteering programs, in which she teaches programming and tech knowledge at schools to increase interest in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) area among children.
