Computer vision wizard and surfer from Portugal. Currently, I am working as a Research Fellow for the [Future AI and Robotics for Space Hub](https://www.fairspacehub.org/), developing visual perception methods for on-orbit robotic operations. I did my PhD on Probabilistic Visual Odometry using RGB-D and Geometric primitives for Man-made Environments.

I am particularly interested in probabilistic estimation methods that can capture uncertainty and using multiple view geometry, deep learning and computer graphics to solve computer vision problems.
