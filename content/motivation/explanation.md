Today, more than 300 million tons of plastic are produced annually. Plastic is everywhere and we constantly use it in our daily life.

The idea of *Plastic object detection project* is to use Artificial Intelligence to detect plastic waste in the environment. 
Our solution  will be applicable for video and photography.
Our goal is to use *AI for Good*.
