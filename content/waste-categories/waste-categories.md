Today, more than 300 million tons of plastic are produced annually. Plastic is everywhere and we constantly use it in our daily life.

The idea of *Plastic object detection project* is to use Artificial Intelligence to detect plastic waste in the environment. 
Our solution  will be applicable for video and photography.

Waste in Gdańsk is segregated into 5 distinctive categories:
* paper – clean and dry
* glass
* metal and plastic
* bio – without animal waste, fat or bones
* residual (non-recycable) waste
